      <p><strong>Multi-Sports  Structures</strong><br>
        The first clear-span air supported structure for a multi-sport application was  installed at Harvard University in 1968. Due to its size, a basic stress relief  strap system was incorporated increasing fabric and membrane strength. The  polyester straps were replaced with steel air craft structural cables. The  configuration of the straps were re-design into various degree bias grid  patterns, providing total encapsulation of the fabric membrane, eliminating the  potential for tear propagation and increasing load-bearing capacity. With this  and many other design modifications, the groundwork was set for our air  supported structures to withstands wind loads of more than 150 MPH and snow  loads in excess of 50 pounds per square foot.</p>
